Blue Cheese Buckwheat Cornbread Muffins

Yields: 12 muffins

Ingredients:

1 cup buckwheat flour
1/2 cup cornmeal
1/4 cup granulated sugar
2 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 1/4 cups milk
1/4 cup (1/2 stick) butter, melted
2 eggs
1 cup crumbled blue cheese
2 scallions, thinly sliced

Directions:

Heat oven to 400 degrees F (375 degrees F if using a dark or nonstick tin). Line a 12-cup muffin tin with paper liners or lightly grease cups.

In a large bowl, whisk together buckwheat flour, cornmeal, sugar, baking powder and salt. In a separate medium bowl, whisk together milk, butter and eggs.

Pour wet ingredients into dry ingredients; stir until just combined. Fold in blue cheese and sliced scallions.

Divide batter among prepared muffin cups. Bake until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, about 20 minutes. Transfer to a cooling rack to cool slightly.
