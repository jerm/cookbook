Brown Rice Salad with Apples, Walnuts, and Cherries

Main Ingredients:

  1 cup brown rice
  3/4 cup frozen peas
  1 apple, diced into 1/2 inch pieces
  1/4 cup dried cherries, roughly chopped
  1/3 cup walnuts, roughly chopped
  1 bunch of chives, finely chopped

Dressing Ingredients:

  2 cloves garlic, minced
  1 tablespoon agave syrup
  1 teaspoon yellow miso paste
  2 tablespoons canola oil
  2 tablespoons balsamic vinegar
  4 tablespoons toasted sesame seeds

Directions:

Cook the brown rice in about two cups of simmering water until tender (See: How to Cook Rice on the Stove Top), or according to package directions. Fluff and cool to room temperature.

Microwave the frozen peas for 1 minute to thaw. Combine the peas, apple, cherries, walnuts, chives, and cooled rice in a large bowl. Whisk together the ingredients for the dressing. Stir the dressing into the rice mix until all the ingredients are coated. Garnish with extra chives and sesame seeds. If you have time, allow rice to rest for at least eight hours or overnight for flavors to come together.

Serves 6 to 8
