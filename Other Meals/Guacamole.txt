Guacamole

Ingredients

    * 4 ripe avocados
    * 1 lime, juiced
    * 1/2 medium red onion, chopped
    * 1 garlic clove, minced
    * 1 vine-ripe tomato, diced
    * 1 big handful fresh cilantro leaves, finely chopped
    * 1/4 teaspoon ground cumin
    * 1/4 teaspoon chili powder
    * Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper

Directions

Halve and pit the avocados; scoop out the flesh with a tablespoon into a mixing bowl. Mash the avocados with a fork, leaving them still a bit chunky. Add the remaining ingredients, and fold everything together to gently mix.

Lay a piece of plastic wrap right on the surface of the guacamole so it doesn't brown and refrigerate for at least 1 hour before serving.
