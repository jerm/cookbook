Pepper Fool's Chili Powder #1

6 dried New Mexico hot peppers
6 dried Chipotle peppers
3 Pasilla Negro peppers
2 Mulato peppers
6 tablespoons cumin seed
6 tablespoons coriander seed
1 tablespoon whole cloves
3 tablespoons celery seed
2 tablespoons ground Cayenne

Break up the New Mexico, chipotle, and mulato chiles. Toast the chiles in small batches on an ungreased skillet, or comal over medium heat until they just begin to release their aroma. Do not let them darken or the may become bitter.

Toast the cumin, coriander, and cloves on an ungreased skillet, or comal over low heat until they release their fragrance and become lightly roasted, about three minutes.

Grind the toasted spices and celery seed (best to use a spice grinder).

Grind the chiles in a spice grinder or food processor.

Mix the ground chiles, spices, and ground cayenne. This receipe is an adaptation of one appearing in New Southwestern Cooking by Dille & Belsinger. Since I never have the chiles called for in the receipe, I invariably "wing it." The spices seem to be the important factor so substituting different chiles doesn't make a major difference in the finished product.
