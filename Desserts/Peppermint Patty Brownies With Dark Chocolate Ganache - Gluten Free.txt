Peppermint Patty Brownies With Dark Chocolate Ganache - Gluten Free

Ingredients

  Brownie Layer

    1 Package Bob’s Red Mill Gluten-Free Brownie Mix
    1 egg
    1 1/2 sticks melted butter
    3/4 cup warm water
    1/2 cup chocolate chips

  Peppermint Patty Layer:

    2 cups powdered sugar
    1 1/2 tbs butter, softened
    3 tbs evaporated milk
    1/4 tsp vegetable oil
    1/4 tsp vanilla extract
    1/2 tsp peppermint extract

  Dark Chocolate Ganache:

    4 ounces of dark chocolate, chopped
    3 tbs heavy cream

Directions

Preheat your oven to 350 degrees.

Grease an 9”x13” baking pan with butter or non-stick spray.

Add your gluten-free brownie mix to a large mixing bowl. Add in your egg, butter, water and mix with electric beaters until everything is combined.

Fold in your chocolate chips.

Bake for 25 minutes, or until a toothpick comes clean when inserted into the center of the pan.

Set them aside to cool.

While your brownies are cooling, you can start on your peppermint layer. Place all of your peppermint layer ingredients into the mixing bowl of an electric mixer. Beat until smooth.

Once brownies are cooled, layer the peppermint mixture on top of your brownies. Place the pan in the refrigerator for thirty minutes, or until the mixture has completely set.

After your peppermint layer has set, it’s time to make your ganache.

Heat up your heavy cream in a small pot. Once it’s hot, add in your chopped up dark chocolate, and stir until the two have completely melted into each other.

Layer the dark chocolate onto the peppermint layer. You can spread it over the whole pan, or spoon it on to each individual brownie.
