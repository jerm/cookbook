Asparagus Ribbons

Ingredients:

  1/2 pound asparagus
  1 1/2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
  1 teaspoon white wine vinegar
  Salt 
  Freshly ground black pepper
  3 tablespoons slivered almonds
  2 tablespoons tarragon leaves

Directions:

Trim the bottom ends off the asparagus and, using a vegetable peeler or mandoline, slice the stalks lengthwise into very thin strips.

In a large bowl, whisk together the olive oil and vinegar and season to taste with salt and pepper. Add the asparagus ribbons and gently toss with your hands until evenly coated. Then add the almonds and tarragon leaves and gently toss to combine.

Transfer to a serving dish(es) and serve immediately.
