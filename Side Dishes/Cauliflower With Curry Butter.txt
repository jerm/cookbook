Cauliflower With Curry Butter

Time: 30 minutes

Ingredients:

  3 pounds cauliflower
  Salt
  4 tablespoons butter
  1/2 teaspoon turmeric
  1/8 teaspoon cayenne
  1/4 teaspoon black pepper
  1/8 teaspoon nutmeg
  1/8 teaspoon cloves
  2 teaspoons grated fresh ginger, or 1/2 teaspoon dry ginger
  2 tablespoons snipped chives
  1 tablespoon fresh lime juice, or to taste.

Directions:

1. With a paring knife, cut the cauliflower into tiny florets, as small as possible. You should have about 8 cups.

2. Meanwhile, bring a large pot of well-salted water to a boil. Working in batches, cook the florets for 1 to 2 minutes, until just cooked but still firm. Drain well and blot on kitchen towels, then cool.

3. Melt the butter in a small saucepan and stir in the turmeric, cayenne, black pepper, nutmeg, cloves and ginger. Put the cooled cauliflower in a large bowl and season lightly with salt. Drizzle the butter over it, toss gently and transfer to an oven-proof serving dish.

4. The cauliflower can be kept at room temperature for 2 to 3 hours until serving time, or covered and refrigerated then brought to room temperature. To serve, heat in a 400-degree oven for 10 minutes. Sprinkle with chives and lime juice.

Yield: 8 to 10 servings.
