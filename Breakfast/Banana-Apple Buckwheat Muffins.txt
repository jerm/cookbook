Banana-Apple Buckwheat Muffins

Yield: Makes 4 muffins

Ingredients

  1/4 cup buckwheat flour
  1 tsp baking powder
  1/2 tsp ground cinnamon
  1/8 tsp coarse salt
  2 large eggs
  1/2 mashed banana
  1/4 cup honey
  1/2 finely diced (peeled and cored) sweet apple (such as Honeycrisp)
  1/4 cup chopped walnuts

Directions

Heat oven to 350 degrees. Place four baking cups in a muffin tin.

In a bowl, whisk together flour, baking powder, cinnamon, and salt. In another bowl, whisk together eggs, banana, and honey. Mix the wet ingredients into the dry, then fold in apple and walnuts.

Fill the batter to the tops of the lined cups and fill remaining cups halfway with water.
