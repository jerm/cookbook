DIRECTIONS

Gently fry onions in a medium saute pan about 5 minutes over low heat. Turn heat up to medium, and add ginger, garlic, cumin seeds and peppers and continue cooking until onions are translucent, about another 5 minutes. Add cloves, peppercorns, cinnamon, brown sugar and cinnamon stick. Cook another 5 minutes.

Meanwhile, press tamarind mixture through sieve and extract as much liquid as possible. Add tamarind juice to sauce, and cook another 5 minutes. Taste - it should be tart and lightly sweet and hot (peppery). Can be cooled and stored in fridge until needed.

When ready to add meat, puree sauce in blender or with hand/stick blender.  Add a little water if it is too thick.
