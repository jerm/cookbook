Vanilla Pudding with Sautéed Pears 

Ingredients

1/3 cup sugar
1/4 cup cornstarch
1/4 teaspoon salt
2 1/2 cups whole milk
4 eggs
1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla
2 tablespoons melted unsalted butter
2 pears
2 tablespoons unsalted butter
2 tablespoons sugar
ground cinnamon

In a medium saucepan, combine sugar with cornstarch and salt. Whisk in milk and eggs until well blended. Over medium-high heat, heat the mixture to simmering, whisking constantly; cook for 1 minute. Remove from heat. Whisk in vanilla and 2 tablespoons melted butter. Pour into a shallow metal bowl and place waxed paper directly on the surface. Refrigerate to chill, about 1 hour.

Core and thinly slice pears. In a skillet, over medium-high heat, melt 2 tablespoons unsalted butter. Sauté the pears in the butter for 3 minutes. Sprinkle with sugar and cook, stirring, until the sugar turns golden, 3 minutes. Spoon the pudding into cups and top with the warm pears; sprinkle with some ground cinnamon.
