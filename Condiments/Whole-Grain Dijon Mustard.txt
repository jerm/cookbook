Whole-Grain Dijon Mustard

1/2 cup dry white wine, such as Sauvignon Blanc
1/2 cup white wine vinegar
1/4 cup brown mustard seeds (about 1 1/2 ounces)
1/4 cup yellow mustard seeds (about 1 1/2 ounces)
1/2 teaspoon kosher salt

Place all of the ingredients in a small, nonreactive bowl and stir to combine. Cover tightly with plastic wrap and place in refrigerator for 1 day.

Remove the plastic wrap and transfer the mustard mixture to a blender. Blend until the desired consistency is reached, about 30 seconds for a coarse texture. (Keep in mind that itâ€™s not possible for this mustard to reach a completely smooth consistency.) Transfer the mustard to a small, nonreactive container with a tight-fitting lid, cover, and refrigerate for up to 3 months.
