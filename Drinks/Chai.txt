Chai

(All measurements are per cup – multiply for the number of cups or medium-sized mugs you are making. There are two approaches: focus on one key spice, like cardamom, or use a smaller quantity of several ingredients)

  3/4 cup water plus 1/4 cup milk
  Sugar to taste
  Roughly ~2 teaspoons per cup loose black tea leaves
    (Ideally Assam or Ceylon tea – English Breakfast will do)

Some or all of the following (measurements are per cup or per medium-sized mug):

  2 green cardamom pods 
  2-3 whole black peppercorns
  1/4 teaspoon fennel seeds
  1-2 pieces cinnamon (“real cinnamon” not Cassia. May be labeled
      “Vietnamese cinnamon”)
  Fresh ginger (2-3 thin slices for extra zing)

Or

  Loose tea masala (a mixture of spices) (Devesh has both the
    MDH and Everest brands. Kalustyans has a loose Tea masala
    sold by weight)
  ginger (see above) if desired

Directions

Heat water and milk. Before it comes to a boil, add fresh ginger (with skin, sliced into thin rounds), if using and any or several of the following: a few pods of green cardamom, Cinnamon stick, fennel seeds, peppercorns and/or cinnamon. Devesh used 1/8 teaspoon of tea masala per cup and fresh ginger, skipping the other spices. When the milk / water mixture boils, add loose black tea. Turn off the heat and let steep for 2 minutes. Pour into a cup through a sieve to strain out tea leaves and spices. Add sugar / sweetener to taste.
