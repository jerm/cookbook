Tarka daal (for 3 people)

Ingredients

    Dal:
    * 1/2 lb Split Moong daal
    * 1/2 tsp of turmeric
    * Water
    * 1 tbsp ginger paste
    * Salt to taste

    Tarka 1:
    * Oil 
    * pinch of cumin seeds
    * 1 medium onion (chopped)

    Tarka 2:
    * Oil 
    * 2 tbsp of cumin seeds + a pinch
    * 3 red chillies
    * 3 tomatoes (pasted in blender)
    * 4 cloves of garlic (finely chopped)

Steps:

Wash the moong daal in water then cook on medium heat, add turmeric at the start. Keep adding water as required to ensure lentils donâ€™t get dry.

Just as the lentils start to get soft, add ginger paste and salt. Cook on low heat till lentils are fully cooked.

In a small pan, add some oil and pinch of cumin seeds, now add the onions, cook till translucent or brown if you prefer that sweeter caramelised taste.

Once onions are cooked, add to the cooked moong daal and mix.

Now the tarka, in a small pan, add oil, cumin seeds and red chillies, once the cumin seeds start to brown and the oil has been infused with the red chillies add the tomatoes and garlic. Cook for a few minutes and then pour the tarka over the daal and stir the whole mixture.
