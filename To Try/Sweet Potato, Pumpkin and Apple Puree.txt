Sweet Potato, Pumpkin and Apple Puree 

Ingredients

  1 pound sweet potatoes, scrubbed
  1 pound pumpkin, seeds removed
  2 tart apples, such as Granny Smith or Braeburn
  2 tablespoons lime juice
  5 tablespoons plain Greek-style yogurt
  2 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted
  2 tablespoons maple syrup
  Pinch of salt
  Pinch of freshly grated nutmeg

Directions

1. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees. Scrub sweet potatoes, and pierce in several places with a sharp knife. Pierce the apples in a few places. Line a baking sheet with foil, lightly oil the foil, and place the potatoes, pumpkin (cut side down) and apples on top. Bake the pumpkin and apples for 30 to 40 minutes, until a knife can easily be inserted right to the core of the apples (itâ€™s fine if the skin pops off the apples, or if they collapse) and the pumpkin is soft. Remove the pumpkin and apples from the oven. Continue to bake the sweet potatoes until thoroughly soft and beginning to ooze, 15 minutes or longer, depending on the size. Remove from the heat, and allow to cool until you can handle them easily.

2. Turn the oven down to 350 degrees. Remove the skins from the potatoes and pumpkin. Peel and core the apples, and scrape off any apple flesh that adheres to the skin. Chop everything coarsely, and place in a food processor fitted with the steel blade. Puree until smooth. Add the remaining ingredients, and blend well. Transfer to a lightly buttered 2-quart baking dish.

3. Heat the puree in the 350-degree oven for 20 minutes, or until steaming. Serve hot.
