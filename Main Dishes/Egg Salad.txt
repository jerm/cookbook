Egg Salad

Ingredients

  6 large eggs
  1/2 cup mayo
  1/2 teaspoon hot paprika
  1 cup small-dice celery, about 2 stalks
  1 tbsp mustard

Directions

1. Place the eggs in a medium saucepan. (They should sit in a single layer.) Add enough cold water to cover them by 1 inch. Bring to a boil over high heat, remove the pan from the heat, cover with a tightfitting lid, and let the eggs sit in the hot water for 8 minutes.

2. Using a slotted spoon, transfer the eggs to a large bowl and fill the bowl with enough cold water to cover the eggs by a few inches. Gently crack the shells against the side of the bowl. Let the eggs sit in the water until cool, about 10 minutes.

3. In a large bowl, combine the egg, mayonnaise, paprika and celery. Mash well with a fork or wooden spoon.
