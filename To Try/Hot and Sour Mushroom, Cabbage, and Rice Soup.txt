Hot and Sour Mushroom, Cabbage, and Rice Soup

Ingredients:

  1 tablespoon canola oil
  4 ounces cremini or shiitake mushroom caps, thinly sliced
  1 to 3 jalapeno peppers, finely diced
  6 cloves garlic, minced
  One 3-inch lump ginger, grated (or 1 tablespoon ginger puree)
  1 to 3 limes, zested and juiced
  8 cups broth â€” turkey, chicken, or vegetable
  1/2 cup jasmine rice
  2 tablespoons soy sauce, plus more to serve
  1/2 small head green cabbage, cut in half and shaved thin
  Chili garlic sauce or kimchi, to serve

Directions:

Heat the oil in a large heavy pot or Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Add the mushrooms and cook for 5 minutes without stirring. Toss the mushrooms after 5 minutes and cook for an additional 5 minutes, or until well-browned. Add the diced peppers, garlic, and ginger and cook for about five minutes or until fragrant and slightly softened.

Add the lime zest and broth and bring to a simmer. Add the rice, cover, and simmer for about 20 minutes or until the rice is just barely soft. Add the shaved cabbage, lime juice, and soy sauce to taste and simmer for another few minutes or until cabbage is hot.

Serve with extra soy sauce, lime wedges, and kimchi or chili garlic sauce.

Makes eight to ten 1-cup servings
