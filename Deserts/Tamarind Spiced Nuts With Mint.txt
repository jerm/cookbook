Tamarind Spiced Nuts With Mint

Ingredients:

  4 tablespoons unsalted butter
  3 tablespoons honey
  2 tablespoons light brown sugar
  1 teaspoon tomato paste
  1 1/2 teaspoons tamarind concentrate or paste
  1 pound roasted unsalted cashews
  70 grams unsweetened coconut flakes (about 1 cup)
  Large pinch cayenne, plus more to taste
  10 grams ground garam masala, preferably freshly toasted and ground (about 1 tablespoon)
  8 grams coarse kosher salt, plus more for sprinkling (about 1 1/4 teaspoons)
  Chopped fresh mint, for serving

Directions:

1. Heat oven to 300 degrees.

2. In a medium pot, melt butter, honey, brown sugar, tomato paste and tamarind. Add nuts, coconut, cayenne, garam masala and salt and toss until coated. Spread on baking sheet.

3. Bake for about 25 minutes, stirring occasionally, until mixture is toasted and sugars have begun to caramelize. Sprinkle nuts lightly with salt and let cool completely. Before serving, break up nuts and sprinkle with mint. (Nuts can be stored in an airtight container up to 2 weeks, but donâ€™t add mint until serving.)
