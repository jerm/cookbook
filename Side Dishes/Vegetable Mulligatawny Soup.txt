Vegetable Mulligatawny Soup

Ingredients

    * 1 teaspoon whole black peppercorns
    * 2 tablespoons whole coriander seeds
    * 1 teaspoon whole cumin seeds
    * 1/2 teaspoon whole fennel seeds
    * 1/2 teaspoon ground turmeric
    * 1/4 teaspoon cayenne
    * 1 1/2 tablespoons chickpea flour
    * 4 to 5 cups vegetable stock (bouillon cubes may be used here)
    * 2 small potatoes (8 ounces), peeled and diced
    * 2 medium carrots, peeled and sliced
    * 2 small turnips (8 ounces), peeled and diced
    * 12 fresh curry leaves or 8 fresh basil leaves
    * 2 garlic cloves, peeled and coarsely chopped
    * 1 medium onion, coarsely chopped
    * 1 tablespoon peeled and finely chopped fresh ginger
    * 1 (14-ounce) can coconut milk
    * 1 1/4 teaspoons salt, or to taste
    * Lime wedges for serving

Directions

Put the peppercorns, coriander seeds, cumin seeds, and fennel seeds in a small cast-iron frying pan and set over medium-high heat. Stir and roast until the spices emit a roasted aroma and some turn a shade darker. Empty into a plate to cool, then grind in a clean coffee grinder or other spice grinder. (It is a good idea to sift the ground spices through a fine sieve, stirring them about with a spoon as they pass slowly through the mesh. This is not absolutely necessary, but it makes for a finer soup.) Add the turmeric and cayenne to the spice mixture.

Put the chickpea flour in a bowl. Slowly add 2 tablespoons of the stock, mixing as you go. Add another 4 cups of stock and mix.

Combine the chickpea flour mixture, spices, all the vegetables, the curry leaves, garlic, onion, and ginger in a large pan and bring to a boil. Cover, turn the heat down to low, and simmer for about 50 minutes, or until all the vegetables are tender. Blend the soup in a blender in several batches, if necessary, and then press through a coarse sieve. Return the soup to the soup pan, add the coconut milk and salt, and bring to a simmer. Simmer gently for 2 to 3 minutes to blend the flavors; thin out with more stock, as needed. Serve hot with lime wedges.
