Creamy Curried Cauliflower Soup

Ingredients:

  2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, plus more to serve
  2 medium white onions, thinly sliced
  1/2 teaspoon kosher salt, plus more to season
  4 cloves garlic, minced
  1 large head of cauliflower (about 2 pounds), trimmed and cut into florets 
  4 1/2 cups low-sodium vegetable broth (or water)
  1/2 teaspoon coriander
  1/2 teaspoon turmeric
  1 1/4 teaspoon cumin
  1 cup coconut milk
  Freshly-ground black pepper, to season
  1/4 cup roasted cashew halves, for garnish (optional, see Recipe Note)
  1/4 cup finely chopped Italian parsley, for garnish (optional)
  red chile pepper flakes, for garnish (optional)

Directions:

Heat oil in a large pot over medium heat until shimmering. Cook the onions and 1/4 teaspoon salt until onions are soft and transluscent, 8-9 minutes. Reduce heat to low, add garlic and cook for 2 additional minutes. Add cauliflower, vegetable broth, coriander, turmeric, cumin, and remaining 1/4 teaspoon salt. Bring pot to a boil over medium-high heat, then reduce the heat to low. Simmer until cauliflower is fork-tender, about 15-17 minutes

Working in batches, purée the soup in a blender until smooth, and then return the soup to the soup pot. (Alternatively, use an immersion blender to purée the soup right in the pot.) Stir in the coconut milk and warm the soup. Taste and add more salt, pepper or spices if you’d like.

To serve, ladle the soup into favorite bowls and garnish with a handful of toasted cashews, a few springs of parsley, sprinkle of red chile flakes and a dash of olive oil to top.

Recipe Notes:

- To Toast the Cashews:  Preheat the oven to 350°F and lay cashews out on a baking sheet in a nice flat layer. Toast for 5-6 minutes, or until fragrant.
