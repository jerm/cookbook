Massaman Curry

Active Time:  15 Minutes
Total Time:  30 Minutes
Yield:  Serves 4

So many curries are made throughout the world that it's hard to pick favorites. But this dish, based on a Thai and Muslim combination including potatoes, peanuts, and five-spice powder, must be one of the best.

RECIPE INGREDIENTS

1 tablespoon cooking oil
1 onion, chopped
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 teaspoon chopped fresh ginger
1 teaspoon Chinese five spice powder
1 teaspoon ground cumin
1/4 teaspoon cayenne
1/4 teaspoon turmeric
1 teaspoon salt
1 cup canned low-sodium chicken broth or homemade stock
1/2 cup canned unsweetened coconut milk or heavy cream
1/2 pound boiling potatoes (about 2), peeled and cut into 1/2-inch pieces
1 1/3 pounds boneless, skinless chicken breasts (about 4), cut into 1/2-inch pieces
1/2 cup chopped peanuts
1/2 pound plum tomatoes (about 4), cut into wedges
3 tablespoons chopped cilantro

DIRECTIONS
In a large saucepan, heat the oil over moderately low heat. Add the onion and cook, stirring occasionally, until it is translucent, about 5 minutes. Add the garlic, ginger, five-spice powder, cumin, cayenne, turmeric, and 1/2 teaspoon of the salt. Stir until fragrant, about 1 minute. Whisk in the broth and then the coconut milk; bring to a simmer. Stir in the potatoes, cover, and cook over low heat until they are almost tender, about 12 minutes.

Add the chicken to the sauce, cover, and simmer for 5 minutes. Stir in the peanuts, tomatoes, cilantro, and the remaining 1/2 teaspoon salt. Turn the heat off, cover, and let steam until the chicken is just done, about 2 minutes longer.

Menu Suggestion

For this curry, steamed white rice is the only accompaniment you need.
