Chili Powder

INGREDIENTS:
* 1 teaspoon paprika
* 2 teaspoons ground cumin
* 1 teaspoon cayenne pepper
* 1 teaspoon oregano
* 2 teaspoons garlic powder

PREPARATION:
Combine all ingredients; store in an airtight container.

If you want something a little bit more traditional, consider the following recipe.

Chili Powder #2
* 2 tablespoons cumin seeds
* 3 dried cayenne peppers
* 6 dried ancho chilies
* 1 tablespoon ground Mexican oregano
* 2 tablespoons garlic powder

In a small skillet, toast the cumin seeds over medium-high heat until browned, approximately 5 to 7 minutes.Remove seeds from heat and grind in a food processor. Set aside.

Toast the chiles in small batches on an ungreased skillet, or comal over medium heat until they just begin to release their aroma. Do not let them darken or the may become bitter.

The spices seem to be the important factor so substituting different chiles doesn't make a major difference in the finished product. Break the stems from all the chiles and remove the seeds. Grind dried chillies or chilli flakes in a coffee grinder. Combine all ingredients; store in an airtight container.
