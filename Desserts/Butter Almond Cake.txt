Butter Almond Cake (serves 8-10)

This recipe was printed in our local paper years ago. Kris believes it originally came from Learning to Cook with Marion Cunningham, which is full of foolproof recipes. Takes 5 minutes plus baking time.

    * 1-1/2 cups granulated sugar
    * 3/4 cup real butter, melted
    * 2 eggs
    * 1-1/2 teaspoons almond extract
    * 1-1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract
    * 1/4 teaspoon salt
    * 1-1/2 cups all-purpose flour
    * 3 Tablespoons sliced almonds (optional)
    * 1 Tablespoon granulated sugar (for garnish)

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Use butter wrappers to generously grease a 9" round cake pan. With a mixer, blend together the sugar and melted butter. Add eggs, one at a time, and beat in. Stir in extracts. Add salt and flour and mix until everything is incorporated. Spread batter in the pan and sprinkle the top with sliced almonds (optional) and 1 Tablespoon sugar. Bake 30-35 minutes, or until golden brown. Cool completely on a wire rack before removing from pan. If desired, serve with whipped cream or fruit on the side. (Home-canned peaches go especially well!)
