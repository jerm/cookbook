Chipotle Sauce

Ingredients

    * 2 dried ancho chiles (1 oz)
    * 1 dried chipotle chile
    * 2 cups water
    * 1 small yellow onion, coarsely chopped
    * 2 garlic cloves
    * 1 tablespoon cumin seeds, toasted

Preparation

Discard stems from chiles and remove seeds. Rinse chiles under cold running water. Bring chiles with water to a simmer in a nonreactive 1 1/2-quart saucepan. Add onion, garlic, and a pinch of salt, then simmer, uncovered, stirring occasionally (add more water if necessary to cover chiles), until softened, about 30 minutes.

While chiles are cooking, finely grind cumin seeds with a mortar and pestle or in an electric coffee/spice grinder.

Transfer chiles and vegetables with a slotted spoon to a blender and purée with cumin and cup chile water (save remaining chile water) until smooth. (Sauce should be thick but not stiff; add more chile water, 1 tablespoon at a time, if necessary.) Season with salt.

Cooks' note: Sauce may be made 3 days ahead, cooled completely, and chilled, covered. Reheat before serving.
