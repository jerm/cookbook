Chinese Five Spice Stir Fry

Ingredients
1 tbsp. peanut or vegetable oil
1 pound boneless, skinless chicken breast, cut into strips
1 red or green pepper, sliced
1 1/2 cups vegetables such as baby corn, broccoli, snow peas, bok choy etc.
1 tsp. Chinese five spice powder
1 tbsp. sesame seed
1 tsp. corn starch
1 tbsp. light or flavored soy sauce
1/3 cup water

Heat the oil in a wok or large frying pan and sauté the chicken for 4-5 minutes until no longer pink and lightly browned. Add the vegetables, five spice powder and sesame seeds. Stir-fry for 2-3 minutes at a fairly high (but not scorching) heat. Blend the cornstarch with the soy sauce and water. Push the vegetables and meat aside and pour into the hot skillet. Bring it to a boiling then stir it into the mixture. Stir fry for another 2 minutes or so. If at any time the heat seems to high, turn it down some and add a little water if it seems dry. Four servings.
