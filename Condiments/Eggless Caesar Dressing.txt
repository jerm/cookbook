Eggless Caesar Dressing

Ingredients

  5 anchovy filets
  3 cloves garlic, chopped
  1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
  1/4 cup lemon juice
  2 tablespoons sherry or red wine vinegar
  1 tablespoon Dijon mustard
  1/2 cup extra virgin olive oil
  1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese

Directions

With a mortar and pestle, bash the anchovies, garlic and pepper.  Whisk in the lemon juice, vinegar and mustard. Slowly whisk in the oil until emulsified. Stir in the parmesan and taste for seasoning. 

Alternatively, combine all ingredients in a blender and puree until emulsified. 

Refrigerate in a sealed container for up to one week. Toss liberally with romaine lettuce, croutons and additional Parmesan for an authentic eggless Caesar salad.
