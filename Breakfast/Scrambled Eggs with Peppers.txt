Scrambled Eggs With Peppers

Ingredients:

  2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
  2 large or 3 medium red peppers, or a combination of red
    and green peppers, diced (about 1 to 1 1/4 pounds)
  1 Anaheim pepper, diced (optional)
  2 plump garlic cloves, minced
  Salt to taste
  1 pound tomatoes, seeded and grated, or peeled, seeded
    and diced; or 1 (14-ounce) can, drained
  1 teaspoon fresh thyme leaves or 1/2 teaspoon dried thyme
  Freshly ground pepper to taste
  6 eggs

Directions:

1. Heat the oil in a large nonstick skillet or heavy casserole over medium heat. Add the peppers. Cook, stirring often, for five minutes. Add the garlic and a generous pinch of salt. Cook, stirring, until the garlic smells fragrant, about one minute. Add the tomatoes, thyme, salt and pepper. Bring to a simmer, and simmer, stirring from time to time, until the tomatoes have cooked down somewhat, about 10 minutes. Cover, and reduce the heat. Simmer over low heat for another 15 to 20 minutes, stirring from time to time, until the mixture is thick and fragrant.

2. Beat the eggs in a medium bowl and season to taste with salt and pepper. Turn the heat to medium, and stir in the eggs. Cook, stirring every few seconds, until the eggs are scrambled. Remove from the heat and serve.
