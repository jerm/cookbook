Roasted Sweet Potato Salad with Black Beans and Chili Dressing

Ingredients:
  4            medium sweet potatoes (about 1 1/2 pounds), peeled
               and cut into 1-inch chunks
  1            large onion, preferably red, chopped
  1/2 cup      extra virgin olive oil
  Salt 
  Freshly ground black pepper
  1 - 2 tbsp   minced fresh hot chili, like jalape√±o
  1 clove      garlic, peeled
  2            limes, juiced
  2 cups       cooked black beans, drained (canned are fine)
  1            red or yellow bell pepper, seeded and finely diced
  1 cup        chopped fresh cilantro

Directions:

1. Heat oven to 400 degrees. Put sweet potatoes and onions on a large baking sheet, drizzle with 2 tablespoons oil, toss to coat and spread out in a single layer. Sprinkle with salt and pepper. Roast, turning occasionally, until potatoes begin to brown on corners and are just tender inside, 30 to 40 minutes. Remove from oven; keep on pan until ready to mix with dressing.

2. Put chilies in a blender or mini food processor along with garlic, lime juice, remaining olive oil and a sprinkle of salt and pepper. Process until blended.

3. Put warm vegetables in a large bowl with beans and bell pepper; toss with dressing and cilantro. Taste and adjust seasoning if necessary. Serve warm or at room temperature, or refrigerate for up to a day.
