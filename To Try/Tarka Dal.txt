Tarka dal

Ingredients

  Dal (the lentis/peas/beans)
    2/3 cup (160g) lentils, split peas or mung beans
    2 cups (500ml) water
    1 tsp turmeric
    1 tsp cumin
    1 tsp salt

  Tarka (the sauce)
    3-4 TBL unsalted butter
    1 medium onion, diced
    3-4 cloves garlic
    1-3 dried red chilies (had to leave these out this time)

Boil together the dal, water, turmeric, cumin and salt. When the water reaches a boil, lower heat and simmer about 20 minutes or until the dal reaches a soft consistency.

Meanwhile, prepare the tarka. Saute onions and garlic in butter until onions are translucent and starting to brown. Add crushed chilies and warm through. Remove from heat.

Add half of tarka to cooked dal and stir well. Remove dal to serving bowl and garnish top with remaining tarka.
