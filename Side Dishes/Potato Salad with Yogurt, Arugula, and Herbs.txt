Potato Salad with Yogurt, Arugula, and Herbs

Ingredients:

  1 1/2 pounds new potatoes, cleaned
  Salt and freshly ground black pepper
  1/2 cup whole milk yogurt
  1/4 cup mayonnaise
  2 large shallots, peeled and thinly sliced
  1 large bunch arugula leaves, roughly chopped
  1 small bunch fresh dill, finely chopped

Directions:

Fill a four quart (or larger) pot 3/4 full of water. Salt generously with at least 1 tablespoon of salt. Bring to a boil over high heat and add the potatoes. Bring back to a simmer and then turn the heat down to medium. Cook for 15 to 20 minutes, or until the potatoes can be easily pierced with a fork. Drain the potatoes and return them to the pot.

Use a fork to pull a hot potato out of the pot, and slice it into quarters. Repeat with the rest of the potatoes, adding them to a large bowl as you cut them up.

Whisk together the yogurt and mayonnaise. Toss the potatoes with this dressing, then toss with the shallots, arugula, and dill. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Refrigerate for at least an hour before serving.
