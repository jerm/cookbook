Honey Dijon Mustard

Ingredients

  1 large onion
  3 cloves garlic
  2 cups dry white wine
  4 ounces dry mustard
  4 tablespoons honey
  1 tablespoon vegetable oil
  2 teaspoons salt

Directions

1) Peel and finely chop onion. Peel and mince garlic. Combine onion and garlic with wine in a saucepan. Bring to a boil and then reduce heat and simmer for 10 minutes. Remove from heat and cool slightly. Pour through a strainer and discard onion and garlic.

2) Add dry mustard to flavored wine to make a paste. Add honey, oil, and salt and mix well. Return mixture to saucepan and cook over low heat until it thickens while you stir constantly. (Since there are no thickening agents used, you will be thickening it by evaporating the liquid away.)

3) Cool to room temperature and then stir well and store in a covered jar in refrigerator. Yield: 1-1/2 cups.
