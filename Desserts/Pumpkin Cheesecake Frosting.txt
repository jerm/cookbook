Pumpkin Cheesecake Frosting 

Ingredients

  8 oz cream cheese, room temperature
  1/4 C unsalted butter, room temperature
  1/2 C pumpkin puree
  3 C powdered sugar, sifted

Directions

1. Mix cream cheese and butter until smooth and creamy.

2. Mix in pumpkin puree.

3. Slowly mix in the powdered sugar. You can add more sugar to make the frosting stiffer, but I think that makes it too sweet.
