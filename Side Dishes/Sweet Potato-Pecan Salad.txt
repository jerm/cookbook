Sweet Potato-Pecan Salad

Ingredients

  4 medium sweet potatoes (about 2 pounds), peeled and cut into
    uniform 2-inch chunks
  2 tablespoons salt
  1/2 red bell pepper, seeded and diced small
  1/2 green bell pepper, seeded and diced small
  1/2 large red onion, diced small
  1/4 cup finely chopped parsley
  3 tablespoons Dijon mustard
  3 tablespoons ketchup
  1 teaspoon minced garlic
  3/4 cup olive oil
  1/4 cup cider vinegar
  1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce
  2 tablespoons fresh lime juice
  Salt and pepper to taste
  1/3 cup pecan halves, lightly toasted

Directions

1. Fill sink or a large bowl with water and ice cubes. Put sweet potatoes in a large saucepan, add the salt and water to cover, and bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce heat to medium and simmer until potatoes can be easily pierced with a fork but still offer some resistance and donâ€™t break apart, 10 to 12 minutes.

2. Drain potatoes and immediately put them into the ice-water bath. After 1 minute, remove potatoes, drain again, and put into a large bowl along with diced peppers, onion and parsley.

3. Make the dressing: In a large bowl, combine mustard, ketchup and garlic. Add olive oil in a slow, steady stream, whisking constantly. Whisk in vinegar, Worcestershire and lime juice, then season to taste with salt and pepper.

4. Pour dressing over sweet potatoes, add pecans and toss gently.
