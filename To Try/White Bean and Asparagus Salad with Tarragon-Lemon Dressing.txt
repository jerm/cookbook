White Bean and Asparagus Salad with Tarragon-Lemon Dressing

INGREDIENTS

  8 ounces dried white beans or 2 (15-ounce) cans Great Northern or cannellini beans
  Salt
  2 bay leaves, if using dried beans
  1 pound asparagus
  1/2 cup tarragon leaves
  1 teaspoon packed finely grated lemon zest
  2 garlic cloves, peeled
  1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
  1 large lemon, juiced, plus more to taste
  1/2 cup olive oil

PREPARATION

1. If using canned beans, drain and rinse. If using dried beans, soak in plenty of water for 6 hours or overnight. Drain beans and transfer to a medium pot. Cover beans by 2 inches with water and add 1 1/2 teaspoons salt and the bay leaves. Simmer until just tender but not at all mushy, about 45 minutes to 1 1/2 hours, depending upon what kind of beans youâ€™re using. Drain.

2. Break off tough ends of the asparagus. Bring a medium pot of salted water to a boil and prepare a bowl with ice and cold water. Blanch trimmed asparagus for 1 1/2 minutes, or until just cooked through but still firm, then plunge them into the ice bath. Let sit for 5 minutes, then drain. Pat dry and slice diagonally into 1/2-inch pieces.

3. In a blender or food processor, combine tarragon, lemon zest, garlic, 1 teaspoon salt, the black pepper and the lemon juice, and process until garlic is chopped. Pour in olive oil. Process until mixture is well blended and bright green, about 1 minute.

4. In a large mixing bowl, gently toss together beans, asparagus and dressing. Taste and add more lemon juice and salt if needed.

TOTAL TIME: 20 minutes, plus soaking and cooking time if using dried beans
