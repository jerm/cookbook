Braised Carrots with Cumin and Red Pepper

Time: 30 minutes

Ingredients:

  3 pounds medium carrots, peeled
  4 tablespoons olive oil
  Salt
  6 garlic cloves, sliced
  1/2 teaspoon cumin seed, toasted and coarsely ground
  2 teaspoons mild red pepper flakes, like Aleppo or Marash
  2 teaspoons paprika, smoked or unsmoked.

Directions:

1. Cut the carrots lengthwise, or quarter them if you wish.

2. Warm the olive oil in a large Dutch oven or heavy bottomed pot over medium heat. Add the carrots and turn them in the oil to coat. Season generously with salt. Add the garlic and 1 cup of water. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to a gentle simmer and cover the pan. Cook for about 10 minutes, until the carrots are just tender.

3. Remove the lid, raise the heat, and let any remaining water cook away.

4. Sprinkle the cumin, red pepper and paprika over the carrots and transfer them to an oven-proof serving dish. Serve hot or at room temperature. The carrots may be left at room temperature for 2 to 3 hours, or refrigerated and brought to room temperature, before reheating in a 400-degree oven for 10 minutes.

Yield: 8 to 10 servings.
