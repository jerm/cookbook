Stuffed Omelet

Medina - Saudi Arabia

Because of Medina's very warm climate, the diet is light, though spicy.

Ingredients:

  4 tbsp butter, split 3 tbsp / 1 tbsp
  20-30 peanuts, ground / minced
  2 garlic cloves, thinly sliced
  1/2 pound meat, ground or small chunks
  1/2 cup thinly sliced onions
  2 teaspoons sugar
  1 1/2 tbsp soy sauce
  1/8 tsp black pepper
  6 eggs, beaten
  1/2 cup milk

Directions:

Heat large skillet over medium-low heat. Add 3 tbsp butter, peanuts and garlic. Cook for 2-3 minutes, stirring frequently.

Add meat, onions, sugar, soy sauce and pepper to the skillet. Stir to combine and mix. Cook for 7-10 minutes or until meat cooked through. Place contents of the skillet into a bowl and hold to the side.

Beat in two batches, 3 eggs with 1/4 cup milk. For each batch, place 1/2 tbsp butter in the skillet, with the egg/milk mixture. Cook through and flip. Place half the filling on top of the cake and fold in half. Serve warm.
