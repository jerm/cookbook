Italian Salad Dressing

Ingredients

  1 cup neutral salad oil, such as canola (See Recipe Note)
  1/4 cup white wine vinegar
  2 tablespoons red wine vinegar
  1 large garlic clove, pressed
  2 tablespoons finely chopped shallots
  2 tablespoons finely chopped red bell pepper
  2 teaspoons Dijon mustard
  1 teaspoon honey
  1 teaspoon kosher salt, plus more to taste
  1/4 teaspoon dried oregano
  1/4 teaspoon dried marjoram
  Pinch of red pepper flakes
  Freshly ground black pepper, to taste

Directions

Combine all of the ingredients in a jar with a tight fitting lid. (I love this shaker.) Shake vigorously until the mixture is thickened and well-combined. Alternatively, combine the ingredients in a bowl and whisk until combined.

Taste the dressing using a lettuce leaf and adjust seasonings. The dressing will keep in the refrigerator for several weeks.

Recipe Notes:
Italian Dressing with Olive Oil: Olive oil can be substituted for the neutral oil in this dressing, though I find that olive oil can have tendency to overwhelm the other flavors.
Making More or Less Dressing: This dressing makes enough for several dinner salads over the course of a week or so. To make more for larger salads or less for a single salad, just scale the ingredients to make the amount you need.

Makes 1 1/2 cups (using 2-4 tablespoons per salad)
