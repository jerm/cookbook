Tarka Dal (4)

  Dal:
    1 onion (chopped) 
    1 cup split red lentils
    1 fresh red chilli (chopped)
    1 fresh green chilli (chopped)
    1 heaped teaspoon ground cumin
    1 heaped teaspoon ground coriander
    1/2 teaspoon garam masala
    1 teaspoon salt

  Tarka:
    1 small onion (very finely chopped)
    3 tablespoons peanut oil
    1 teaspoon mustard seeds
    1 teaspoon cumin seeds
    20 curry leaves


DIRECTIONS:

Put the lentils in a pan with 3 cups water and bring to a simmer.  Cook gently over low heat for 15 minutes.  Add the rest of the Dal ingredients.  Continue cooking for 10-5 minutes until thick and creamy. Remove from the heat.

To make the tarka: Heat the oil over a medium/high heat until just smoking. Add the mustard and cumin seeds and sizzle for 10-15 seconds. Add the curry leaves and stir briefly. Tip in the onion and stir fry for 2 minutes. Remove from the heat then tip the tarka into the dal. Stir well and serve.
