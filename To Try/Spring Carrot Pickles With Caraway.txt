Spring Carrot Pickles With Caraway

Ingredients:

  1 to 2 cups very thinly sliced carrots (slice on the diagonal),
              preferably an assortment of young orange, yellow and
              purple carrots from the farmers’ market
  2 teaspoons caraway seeds
  1/2 cup (135 grams) seasoned rice wine vinegar
  1 tablespoon (15 grams) sherry vinegar
  1/4 cup (50 grams) sugar
  1 cup (230 grams) water
  2 1/4 teaspoons (10 grams) kosher salt

Directions:

1. Place the carrots and caraway seeds in a bowl or jar.

2. In a large bowl, combine the rice wine vinegar, sherry vinegar and sugar. Bring the water to a boil, remove from the heat and add to the vinegar and sugar mixture. Stir until the sugar is dissolved. Add the salt and stir well. Pour over the carrots and caraway, cover and refrigerate for at least 2 days before eating and for up to 2 weeks. These taste best with a longer brine, as the caraway has more time to infuse the brine. Shake the jar from time to time or, if you use a bowl, place a saucer on top of the carrots to keep them submerged. Remove from the brine with a slotted spoon to serve.

Advance preparation: These will be good for a couple of weeks. They’re best left in the brine for at least 5 days before serving.
