Tomato Ketchup

Ingredients

    1 large red onion, peeled and roughly chopped
    1/2 bulb fennel, trimmed and roughly chopped
    1 stick celery, trimmed and roughly chopped
    Thumb-sized piece fresh ginger, peeled and roughly chopped
    2 cloves garlic, peeled and sliced
    1/2 a fresh red chili, deseeded and finely chopped
    1 tablespoon coriander seeds
    2 cloves
    Sea salt
    1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
    Bunch fresh basil, leaves picked, stalks chopped
    Olive oil
    1 pound amazing cherry or plum tomatoes, halved plus 1 pound canned plum
      tomatoes, chopped or 2 pounds yellow, orange or green tomatoes, chopped
    1 1/2 cups cold water
    3/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons red wine vinegar
    1/3 cup soft brown sugar

Directions:

Place onion, fennel, celery, ginger, garlic, chili, coriander seed, clove, salt, ground pepper, and chopped basil stalks in a large heavy-bottomed saucepan with a big splash of olive oil.

Cook gently over a low heat for 10 to 15 minutes until softened, stirring every so often. Add all the tomatoes and 1 1/2 cups of cold water. Bring to the boil and simmer gently until the sauce reduces by half.

Add the basil leaves, then whiz the sauce in a food processor or with a hand blender and push it through a sieve twice, to make it smooth and shiny. Put the sauce into a clean pan and add the vinegar and the sugar. Place the sauce on the heat and simmer until it reduces and thickens to the consistency of tomato ketchup. At this point, correct the seasoning to taste.

Spoon the ketchup through a sterilized funnel into sterilized bottles, then seal tightly and place in a cool dark place or the refrigerator until needed - it should keep for 6 months.
