Panna Cotta

Ingredients:

  1 1/2 cups cream
  1 1/2 cups milk
  1/3 cup sugar
  2 1/4 tsp gelatin
  Flavoring (like vanilla, mint, jelly, etc)

Directions:

To make the panna cotta, warm the cream in a small saucepan, stir in the sugar and gelatin, and cook on low heat — don't boil! —  for about 60 seconds, or until they dissolve. (Rub between your fingers and see if there is any grittiness left.) Whisk in the milk and any flavorings, like vanilla, and pour into 4 to 6 small dishes. 

(If making without dairy, then all almond/coconut/soy milk can be used, or you can increase the fat a little by supplementing with a non-dairy creamer. The pudding will set a little softer.)

Refrigerate. The more shallow the dish, the faster the pudding will set. Give it an hour or two, and it will be done. 

You can serve in little dishes like this, or unmold them to be extra-fancy. Or, if you're serving a big party, just make one big dish, top with fresh fruit, and let everyone scoop out wobbly spoonfuls into their dessert bowls.
