Coconut Dulce de Leche With Caramelized Pineapple

Ingredients

  2 (15.5-ounce) cans unsweetened coconut milk (not low-fat)
  160 grams dark brown sugar ( 2/3 cup plus 2 tablespoons)
  25 grams unsweetened coconut chips or flakes (1/2 cup)
  1 small pineapple, peeled, cored and diced into 1/2-inch pieces (about 4 cups pineapple)
  Flaky sea salt, for garnish (optional)

Directions

1. In a large skillet over low heat, combine coconut milk and 135 grams ( 2/3 cup) sugar. Cook gently, stirring and scraping down the sides of the pan occasionally, until mixture is a deep caramel color, smooth and spreadable, about 1 1/2 to 3 hours, depending on how powerful your stove is. The mixture should remain at a low simmer; do not let it come to a boil. Scrape into a bowl or container and let cool thoroughly, then chill for at least 2 hours and up to 5 days before serving.

2. Heat oven to 325 degrees. Spread coconut on a rimmed baking sheet and toast until golden around the edges, 8 to 12 minutes. Let cool.

3. Toss pineapple with remaining 25 grams (2 tablespoons) sugar. Let fruit stand until sugar dissolves, 1 to 2 minutes.

4. Heat broiler and arrange an oven rack in the position closest to the flame. Spread fruit on a rimmed baking sheet. Broil 4 minutes. Stir, then broil until well-caramelized and charred in places, 3 to 4 minutes more.

5. Spoon dulce de leche into 6 ramekins. Top each with warm pineapple and toasted coconut; sprinkle with salt if using and serve.
