Pancakes without baking powder (#2)

Ingredients

  2 cups all-purpose flour 
  2 eggs 
  2 3/4 cups milk 
  2 tbsp. softened or melted butter or margarine 
  2 tbsp. sugar (or brown sugar) 
  1 tsp. salt
  1/2 tsp. vanilla extract

Directions

1. Sift the flour into a large bowl. Add the salt and sugar and then sift the ingredients again into the bowl.

2. Beat the eggs in a medium bowl. Add the milk to the eggs a little bit at a time.  Add the eggs and milk to the mixing bowl.

3. Add vanilla extract and mix thoroughly with a mixing spoon or whisk.

4. Add a tablespoon of vegetable oil to the skillet and heat on medium until the oil is hot. Turn the burner down to low. Roll the pan around to spread the hot oil across the bottom of the pan.

5. Add spoonfuls of pancake batter to the skillet and cook on low heat until bubbles form on the tops and the sides are not wet.

6. Gently flip the pancakes with a spatula and cook the other side until golden brown. Serve with butter and syrup or honey.
