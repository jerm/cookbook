Whole Roast Chicken

Ingredients

  1 12 ounce russet potato, cut into 1" cubes
  1 12 ounce yam, cut into 1" cubes
  2 large carrots, halved lengthwise, cut crosswise into 1.5" pieces
  3 medium parsnips, peeled, cut into 1.5" pieces
  1.5 tbsp extra virgin olive oil
  3 tbsp unsalted butter, room temperature
  2 tbsp finely chopped fresh sage
  1 garlic clove, pressed
  1 4 pound chicken
  1 tsp coarse kosher salt
  8 cups coarsely torn red or green mustard greens
  1 shallot, minced
  1/2 cup dry white wine
  1/4 cup water

Directions

Toss first 5 ingredients in large roasting pan.  Mix butter, sage, and garlic in small bowl.  Place chicken in center of vegetables.  Using fingertips, loosen skin from breast.  Spread 1 tbsp sage butter under skin.  Rub 1 tbsp sage butter over entire chicken.  Dot vegetables with remaining sage butter.  Sprinkle 1 tsp salt over vegetables and chicken.

Preheat oven to 400 degrees F.  Roast chicken and vegetables 15 minutes.  Reduce oven temperature to 375 degrees F; continue roasting until instant-read thermometer inserted into chicken thigh registers 165 degrees F and vegetables are tender, stirring vegetables once, about 1 hour.

Place greens and shallot on large deep plater.  Spoon 3 tbsp fat from juices in pan and drizzle over greens; tos to coat.  Season with salt and pepper.  Using slotted spoon, transfer roasterd vegetables to platter, placing atop greens.  Tilt chicken, allowing juices to flow from cavity into pan.  Transfer chicken to work surface.  Cut into serving pieces and arrange with vegetables atop greens.

Add wine and 1/4 cup water to roasting pan.  Bring to boil over medium-high heat, stirring to scrape up browned bits.  Simmer until slightly reduced, about 3 minutes.  Season sauce to taste with salt and pepper.  Transfer to small pitcher.  Serve chicken, passing pan juices alongside.
