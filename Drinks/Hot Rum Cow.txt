Hot Rum Cow

Ingredients

  3-8 ounces milk (I used 8 ounces of 2 percent)
  1.5 ounces dark rum (I used Flor de Ca√±a Grand Reserve 7 Year Old)
  1 drop aromatic cocktail bitters (I used Angostura)
  1 drop vanilla extract
  cane syrup, to taste (I substituted plain brown sugar)
  grated cinnamon and/or nutmeg for sprinkling

Directions

Heat the milk in a saucepan on low, taking care not to scorch it. Meanwhile combine bitters, vanilla, and rum in a mug (I pre-warmed mine by filling it first with a bit of hot water, allowing it to stand a minute, and then emptying it before adding the ingredients). Top up with warm milk and stir in brown sugar to taste (I used a single teaspoon of it). Sprinkle with cinnamon and/or nutmeg.

Yield: 1 drink
