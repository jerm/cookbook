Gluten-Free Chocolate Buckwheat Biscotti

Ingredients

  88 grams (approximately 3/4 cup) buckwheat flour
  37 grams (approximately scant 1/3 cup) cornstarch (or omit
           cornstarch and use 125 grams total buckwheat flour)
  120 grams (approximately 1 cup) almond flour
  60 grams (approximately 1/2 cup) unsweetened cocoa
  10 grams (2 teaspoons) instant espresso powder or coffee extract
  10 grams (2 teaspoons) baking powder
  4 grams (1/2 teaspoon) salt
  55 grams (2 ounces) unsalted butter
  125 grams (approximately 2/3 cup, tightly packed) organic brown sugar
  110 grams (2 large) eggs
  10 grams (2 teaspoons) vanilla extract
  100 grams (1 cup) walnuts, chopped

Directions

1. Preheat the oven to 300 degrees. Line a baking sheet with parchment. In a medium bowl, mix together the buckwheat flour, cornstarch (if using), almond flour, cocoa, instant espresso powder (if using), baking powder and salt.

2. In the bowl of an electric mixer cream the butter and sugar for 2 minutes on medium speed. Scrape down the sides of the bowl and the beater with a rubber spatula and add the eggs, coffee extract (if using) and vanilla extract. Beat together for 1 to 2 minutes, until well blended. Scrape down the sides of the bowl and the beater. Add the flour mixture and beat at low speed until well blended. Add the walnuts and beat at low speed until mixed evenly through the dough.

3. Divide the dough and shape 2 wide, flat logs, about 10 inches long by 3 inches wide by 3/4 inch high. Make sure they are at least 2 inches apart on the baking sheet. Place in the oven on the middle rack and bake 40 to 45 minutes, until dry, beginning to crack in the middle, and firm. Remove from the oven and allow to cool for 20 minutes or longer.

4. Place the logs on a cutting board and carefully cut into 1/2-inch thick slices. Place on two parchment-covered baking sheets and bake one sheet at a time in the middle of the oven until the slices are dry, 30 to 35 minutes. Remove from the oven and allow to cool.
