Soybeans With Garlic and Dill 

INGREDIENTS
    1 tablespoon olive oil
    4 tablespoons unsalted butter
    1 large onion, thinly sliced
    5 cloves garlic, minced
    1/4 teaspoon salt, or to taste
    1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper, or to taste
    1 teaspoon turmeric
    4 tablespoons minced fresh dill, or 2 tablespoons dried dill
    1 1/2 cups fresh or frozen shelled edamame (soybeans)
    Cooked rice for serving, optional.

Directions:

1. Fill a kettle with 3 cups of water and bring to a boil. Meanwhile, place a medium saucepan over medium-low heat, and add olive oil and butter. Heat until bubbling. Add onion and sauté until soft, about 8 minutes.

2. Add garlic and sauté until pale gold, about 5 minutes. Add salt, pepper, turmeric and dill. Stir for 1 minute. Add edamame and enough boiling water to barely cover beans.

3. Simmer until beans are just tender, 2 to 3 minutes. Adjust salt and pepper to taste. Serve hot, using a slotted spoon to drain any excess liquid. If desired, serve with rice.
