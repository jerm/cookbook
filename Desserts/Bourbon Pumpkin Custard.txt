Ingredients

  1 (15-ounces) can pure pumpkin
  1 cup heavy cream
  1/3 cup sour cream
  2 large eggs
  3/4 cup sugar
  3 1/2 tablespoons bourbon
  1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
  3/4 teaspoon ground ginger
  1/4 teaspoon ground allspice
  1/4 teaspoon salt

Directions

Preheat oven to 375Â°F with rack in middle.
