Pineapple Curry

INGREDIENTS

  1/2 coconut, grated, or 1 cup unsweetened shredded coconut
  1 teaspoon ground turmeric
  1 small onion, diced
  1 clove garlic, minced
  1 teaspoon cumin seeds
  2 teaspoons coconut oil
  1 teaspoon mustard seeds
  3 fresh curry leaves, available online or in specialty shops
  1 pineapple, about 1 pound, cut into one-inch chunks
  1 teaspoon sugar
  1/2 teaspoon salt

PREPARATION

1. Pulse the coconut, turmeric, onion, garlic and cumin seeds in a food processor until finely chopped and combined. Set aside.

2. Heat the coconut oil in a large saut√© pan over medium heat. Add the mustard seeds and the curry leaves, and let them cook until the mustard seeds pop, about 3 to 4 minutes.

3. Add the coconut mixture and 2/3 cup water and cook for about 3 minutes. Then add the pineapple, sugar, salt and another 1/3 cup water, if needed. Continue cooking until the water has almost been absorbed and the pineapple is soft, about 10 minutes. Adjust the seasonings to taste and serve with rice.
