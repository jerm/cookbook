No-Bake Sesame Coconut Ginger Cookies

Makes about 16 cookies

Ingredients

  1/2 cup unhulled sesame seeds, soaked (see Recipe Notes)
  1/2 cup pitted dates (preferably a soft, moist variety such as Medjool)
  3/4 cup unsweetened shredded coconut 
  2 teaspoons ground ginger
  Tiny dash of sea salt

Directions

Using a food processor, process the dates until they form a paste; it should be fairly smooth but some small pieces are fine. Add the sesame seeds, coconut, ginger, and salt, and process for about 30 seconds until the mixture comes together. It should hold together when pinched.

Shape into balls using 1 tablespoon for each cookie and place on a parchment-lined tray. Flatten the balls to about 1/3-inch thick using your palm or the bottom of a glass (lightly greasing it with coconut oil can help prevent sticking). Freeze until firm.

Store in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to a week.


Recipe Notes

Soaking the sesame seeds: To soak sesame seeds, place them in bowl and cover with water (about a 2:1 ratio) and a pinch of sea salt. Let stand at room temperature for 8 hours. Rinse and drain before using.
Baked version: For a slightly chewier and nuttier version, you can bake the cookies at 300Â°F for about 10 minutes, until they look slightly dry and browned. Let cool completely before handling.
