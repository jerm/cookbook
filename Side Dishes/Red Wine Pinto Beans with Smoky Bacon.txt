Red Wine Pinto Beans with Smoky Bacon

TOTAL TIME 1 hour 45 minutes, plus overnight soaking

INGREDIENTS

  1/2 pound smoky bacon, diced
  1 large onion, peeled and diced
  2 celery stalks, diced
  2 medium carrots, peeled and diced
  4 garlic cloves, minced
  2 large sprigs rosemary
  1 pound dried pinto beans, soaked overnight
  1 tablespoon coarse kosher salt, more to taste
  2 cups dry red wine
  Extra-virgin olive oil, for serving (optional)
  Coarsely grated Parmesan, for serving (optional)
  Coarsely ground black pepper or red pepper flakes, for serving (optional)

PREPARATION

1. In the bottom of a large pot over medium-high heat, brown bacon until golden, about 5 minutes. Stir in onion, celery, carrots, garlic and rosemary. Cook, stirring occasionally, until vegetables are tender, 5 to 7 minutes.

2. Drain beans and add to pot along with 1 tablespoon salt. Pour in enough water to just cover the beans (about 7 to 8 cups). Bring liquid to a boil; reduce heat and simmer gently until beans are just tender, 45 minutes to 1 hour.

3. Meanwhile, in a small pot over medium heat, simmer wine until it is reduced to 2/3 cup, 20 to 30 minutes.

4. Remove rosemary branches from bean pot and discard them. Pour wine into beans and bring to a simmer. Cook for 10 to 20 minutes longer to meld flavors and thicken broth to taste. Drizzle with olive oil and sprinkle with Parmesan, if desired; add more salt and black or red pepper to taste.

YIELD 8 to 10 servings
