Tarka Dal (5)

INGREDIENTS

    Dal:
    * 1/2 c Red split lentils
    * 3 c Water
    * 1 ts Level salt

    Tarka:
    * 1 sm Onion chopped
    * 3 Cloves garlic finely chopped
    * 4 tb Melted ghee
    * Pinch turmeric
    * 1/2 ts Garam masala
    * 1 sm Tomato
    * 2 ts Chopped coriander 


DIRECTIONS

Check the lentils for stones and wash them in several changes of water or until the water starts to run clear. Put the lentils into a saucepan with the water and salt and bring to the boil. Turn the heat down and simmer uncoverd for 20 minutes skimming off the froth that collects at the top. Now partly cover the pan. Cook for a total of an hour stirring now and again. At the end of the hour you should have a pale yellow soup like mixture.

While the dal is cooking fry the onion and garlic in the ghee until the onions are pale brown. Be careful not to burn the garlic as this will add a bad flavour to the dish. Add the turmeric and garam masala to the onions and cook for a few more seconds. Stir the onion mixture into the cooked lentils. 

Serve hot sprinkled with chopped tomato and green coriander.
