Honey Dijon Vinaigrette

Ingredients:

  3/4 cup extra virgin olive oil
  1/4 cup white balsamic vinegar (or white wine vinegar)
  1 Tbsp. Dijon mustard
  1 Tbsp honey
  Kosher salt and ground white pepper (or freshly ground black pepper), to taste

Preparation:

Combine the mustard and vinegar in a glass or stainless steel bowl and whisk them together briefly.

Place the mustard-vinegar mixture along with the oil, honey and seasonings in a blender and mix for about 10 seconds or until fully combined.

Transfer to a glass bowl and let stand for 30 minutes to let the flavors meld. Give the dressing a good whisk immediately before serving.
