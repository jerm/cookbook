Coconut-Cardamom Panna Cotta

Ingredients

  For the panna cotta

    1 1/2 cups half-and-half
    1/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons sugar
    3 cardamom pods, smashed
    1/8 teaspoon salt
    1 cup coconut milk (unsweetened)
    1 1/2 teaspoons powdered gelatin

  For garnish

    1/2 cup blackberries or raspberries, or a mixture
    2 teaspoons sugar
    1/2 teaspoon grated ginger
    2 small nectarines or peaches, optional

Directions

1. In a small saucepan, warm the half-and-half over medium-low heat. Do not allow to simmer. Add sugar, stir to dissolve, then add cardamom and salt. Turn off heat and let cool. Stir in coconut milk.

2. Put gelatin in a small bowl and add 2 tablespoons cold water. Let dissolve, about 5 minutes, then add to half-and-half mixture; stir well. Strain through a fine-meshed sieve into a pitcher. Pour mixture into six 4-ounce ramekins or custard cups. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate until firm, about 2 hours. (May be made several hours or up to a day in advance.)

3. Put berries in a bowl and sprinkle with the sugar and grated ginger. Mix gently and macerate 10 minutes. Add slices of nectarine or peach, if desired. To serve, run a knife around edge of ramekin, then invert ramekin over dish. Shake gently to unmold. Surround panna cotta with fruit, or serve in ramekin with fruit on top.
