Simple Tomato Sauce

Ingredients

  1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil
  1 small onion, chopped
  2 cloves garlic, chopped
  1 stalk celery, chopped
  1 carrot, chopped
  Sea salt and freshly ground black pepper
  4lbs fresh tomatos
  4 to 6 basil leaves
  2 dried bay leaves
  4 tablespoons unsalted butter, optional

Directions

In a large casserole pot, heat oil over medium high heat. Add onion and garlic and saute until soft and translucent, about 2 minutes. Add celery and carrots and season with salt and pepper. Saute until all the vegetables are soft, about 5 minutes. Add tomatoes, basil, and bay leaves and simmer covered on low heat for 1 hour or until thick. Remove bay leaves and check for seasoning. If sauce still tastes acidic, add unsalted butter, 1 tablespoon at a time to round out the flavors.

Add half the tomato sauce into the bowl of a food processor. Process until smooth. Continue with remaining tomato sauce.

If not using all the sauce, allow it to cool completely and pour 1 to 2 cup portions into freezer plastic bags. This will freeze up to 6 months.
