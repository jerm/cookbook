Fiery Sweet Potatoes 

Ingredients

  5 pounds sweet potatoes
  1 cup coconut milk
  1 tablespoon Thai red curry paste
  1/2 cup dark brown sugar
  4 tablespoons unsalted butter
  1 teaspoon salt

Directions

1.  Heat oven to 375 degrees. Bake potatoes on a baking sheet until very soft, about 1 hour. When cool enough to handle, peel and mash.

2. In a small saucepan, heat coconut milk with curry paste over low heat. Mix coconut milk mixture, half the sugar, half the butter, and salt into potatoes. Keep warm until ready to serve, or cover and refrigerate up to two days.

3. At least 30 minutes before serving, heat oven to 425 degrees. Put potatoes in a baking dish, cover with foil and bake for 20 minutes. Uncover potatoes, dot with remaining butter and sugar and broil until brown and crusty on top, checking often to prevent scorching.
