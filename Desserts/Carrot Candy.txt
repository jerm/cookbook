Carrot Candy

Ingredients

  8 medium carrots (about 1 pound)
  1 tablespoon olive oil
  1/2 teaspoon salt
  1/2 teaspoon cumin, optional

Directions

1. Heat the oven to 225 degrees. Peel carrots and cut into 1/8-inch coins. Toss with olive oil, salt and cumin, if you’re using it, then spread on a baking sheet in a single layer. Cook until slightly shriveled, dehydrated and sweet but still soft and chewy. You might have to move them or the pan around to ensure they don’t burn or get too crisp.

2. Start testing carrots after about 2 hours and remove from oven when they’re as chewy or crisp as you like, another 30 to 60 minutes. Cool thoroughly before storing in an airtight container.
