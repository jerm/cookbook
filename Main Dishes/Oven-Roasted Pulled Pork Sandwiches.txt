Oven-Roasted Pulled Pork Sandwiches

Ingredients

  Dry Rub:

    3 tablespoons paprika
    1 tablespoon garlic powder
    1 tablespoon brown sugar
    1 tablespoon dry mustard
    3 tablespoons coarse salt
    1 (5 to 7 pound) pork roast, preferably shoulder or Boston butt
    1/2 of the Cider Vinegar Barbecue Sauce recipe

Directions

Mix the paprika, garlic power, brown sugar, dry mustard, and salt together in a small bowl. Rub the spice blend all over the pork and marinate for as long as you have time for, as little as 1 hour or up to overnight, covered, in the refrigerator.

Preheat the oven to 300 degrees F.

Put the pork in a roasting pan and bake for about 6 hours. Basically, roast the pork until it's falling apart and an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part registers 170 degrees F.

Remove the pork roast from the oven and transfer to a large platter. Allow the meat to rest for about 10 minutes. While still warm, take 2 forks and "pull" the meat to form shreds. Using 2 forks, shred the pork by steadying the meat with 1 fork and pulling it away with the other. Put the shredded pork in a bowl. Pour the Cider Vinegar Barbecue Sauce on the shredded pork and mix well to coat.

To serve, spoon the pulled pork mixture onto the bottom 1/2 of the hamburger bun, and top with the spicy slaw. Serve with pickle spears and the remaining sauce on the side.
