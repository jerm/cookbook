Hot Apple-Ginger Toddy

Ingredients

  a cup or so of apple cider
  1 to 2 ounces of dark liquor (I used applejack, but
     bourbon or dark rum would work well too)
  a drizzle of honey
  a squeeze of lemon
  peeled fresh gingerroot, coarsely chopped (I used a
     thumb-sized piece)
  mulling spices (cinnamon sticks, whole cloves, allspice,
     nutmeg - whatever you have on hand)
  Optional garnishes: cinnamon stick stirrer, lemon slice,
     apple slice, ginger slice

Directions

Add the ginger and mulling spices to the cider and simmer in a saucepan over medium-low heat for at least 5 minutes (or a full 15 or more if you want full flavor). Drizzle some honey into a mug and add the liquor, hot cider, and a squeeze of lemon juice. Stir.

Yield: 1 drink
