Creamy Blue Cheese Dressing

Ingredients

  4 ounces (about 1 heaping cup) blue cheese, crumbled
  1/4 cup sour cream
  1/4 cup buttermilk
  2 tablespoons mayonnaise
  2 tablespoons lemon juice
  Salt and pepper to taste

Directions

In a small bowl, use a fork to mash together the cheese and sour cream until it forms a chunky paste about the consistency of cottage cheese. Stir in the buttermilk, mayonnaise and lemon juice. Taste and season with salt and pepper. Store in a covered container in the refrigerator for up to one week.

Recipe Notes
For a thicker dressing to use as a dip, reduce the lemon juice to 1 tablespoon.
To make a wedge salad, slice a head of iceberg lettuce into 4 quarters. Trim away the core. Drizzle each quarter with 1-2 tablespoons blue cheese dressing and top with 1 teaspoon minced chives and 1 slice of bacon, crumbled.

Makes about 1 1/2 cups
